 * receiving node not being a participant in these states.
 *
 * WARNING: This feature still needs work. Storing fungible states, like cash when you are not the owner will cause
 * problems when using [generateSpend] as the vault currently assumes that all states in the vault are spendable. States
 * you are only an observer of are NOT spendable!
